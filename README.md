# kafka.do

kafka.do is a simple Cloudflare Worker-based API that provides an easy-to-use Kafka topic production and consumption interface with support for webhooks.

If you don't already have a browser extension to pretty-print JSON and make links clickable, start by installing that: <https://extensions.do>

## APIs

For all APIs except list, if a topic does not exist, it is created.

### List all topics

To get a list of all available Kafka topics, send a GET request to the following endpoint:

```
GET /topics
```

#### Example request

```
https://<you>.kafka.do/topics
```

#### Response

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "name": "test-topic-1",
      "created_at": "2022-09-15T10:30:20Z"
    },
    {
      "name": "test-topic-2",
      "created_at": "2022-09-16T14:45:12Z"
    },
    {
      "name": "test-topic-3",
      "created_at": "2022-09-17T09:20:52Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

This endpoint returns a list of Kafka topic objects, each containing the topic name and its creation timestamp.

### Produce a message to a Kafka topic

To produce a message to a Kafka topic, send a GET request to the following endpoint:

```
GET /producer/{topic}/{message}
```

#### Example request

```
https://<you>.kafka.do/producer/test-topic/hello-world
```

#### Response

```json
{
  "topic": "test-topic",
  "message": "hello-world",
  "offset": 42
}
```

### Consume a single message from a Kafka topic

To consume a single message from a Kafka topic, send a GET request to the following endpoint:

```
GET /consumer/{topic}
```

#### Example request

```
https://<you>.kafka.do/consumer/test-topic
```

#### Response

```json
{
  "topic": "test-topic",
  "message": "hello-world",
  "offset": 42
}
```

### Consume multiple messages from a Kafka topic

To consume multiple messages from a Kafka topic in bulk, send a GET request to the following endpoint:

```
GET /consumer/{topic}/{count}
```

Where `{count}` is the number of messages you want to consume at once.

#### Example request

```
https://<you>.kafka.do/bulk-consumer/test-topic/5
```

#### Response

```json
{
  "topic": "test-topic",
  "messages": [
    {
      "message": "hello-world-1",
      "offset": 42
    },
    {
      "message": "hello-world-2",
      "offset": 43
    },
    {
      "message": "hello-world-3",
      "offset": 44
    },
    {
      "message": "hello-world-4",
      "offset": 45
    },
    {
      "message": "hello-world-5",
      "offset": 46
    }
  ]
}
```

This endpoint returns a list of messages from the specified Kafka topic along with their respective offsets. The number of messages in the response may be smaller than the requested count if there are fewer available messages in the topic at the time of the request.

### Webhooks setup

To set up a webhook for consuming messages from Kafka topics automatically, send a GET request to the following endpoint:

```
GET /webhook/{topic}/{callback_url}
```

#### Example request

```
https://<you>.kafka.do/webhook/test-topic/https://yourapp.com/consume
```

#### Response

```json
{
  "topic": "test-topic",
  "callback_url": "https://yourapp.com/consume",
  "webhook_id": "webhook_12345"
}
```

With this webhook setup, whenever there's a new message on the specified topic, kafka.do will automatically send a POST request to the provided `callback_url`. The request body will contain the message as follows:

```json
{
    "topic": "test-topic",
    "message": "hello-world",
    "offset": 42
}
```

## Error messages

In case of an error, the response will contain an `error` message describing the issue:

```json
{
  "error": "Error message"
}
```

Examples of error messages include:

1. "Topic not found"
2. "Invalid webhook URL"
